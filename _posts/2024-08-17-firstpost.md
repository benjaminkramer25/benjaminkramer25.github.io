This is the first post on my blog. Immense credit to Andrew Ye, the best project partner I could've asked for in CSDS 391: Artificial Intelligence at Case Western Reserve University, a known gatekeeper for those interested in the field. His blog has served as nearly complete inspiration for this one. I would also like to thank Gregory Gunderson, who was the creator of this layout which Andrew modified further to his liking.
