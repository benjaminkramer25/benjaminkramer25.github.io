Hello world! My name is Benjamin Kramer, and I am a rising junior at Case Western Reserve University primarily studying mathematics. I have created this website as a medium for organization, as well as expressing thoughts, interests, and ideas through this blog. 

I am interested in the applications of mathematics and computation to biology, in particular the modeling of complex systems and the analysis of genomics and large datasets. I believe it is the objective of scientific study to illustrate mechanisms which improve the human condition. A portion of future blog posts will relate to a subset of the permutations of these fields.

Other interests include linguistics, philosophy, and environmental studies in particular renewable energy and its application to economic systesm and policy, cultivated by my time at [New Sun Road](https://newsunroad.com/). Despite fairly specific interests, my blog will be quite varied and not limited to solely these topics mentioned in this first post. Thus, anything which catched by interest to the point in which I feel the need to comment will uploaded.

It is my honor to give immense credit to my Artificial Intelligence group project partner [Andrew Ye](https://andrew-ye.com/) and in turn [Gregory Gundersen](https://gregorygundersen.com/), of whose websites this site is simply a facsimile. 

Lastly, to close with a piece of music, my favorite violin concerto: [Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C_U7eUbVd8)
