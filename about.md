Hello! My name is Benjamin Kramer, and I am an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University studying mathematics. I'm from and have lived throughout the Bay Area. I enjoy reading, playing golf, as well as the board games Go and chess.  

My research interest lie in computational biological, medical, and health sciences, specifically through advanced algorithms. Despite majoring in mathematics, I enjoy programming and computational problems immensely, and am currently interested in the modeling of dynamic systems, analysis of differentially expressed genes, as well as statistical regression to determine causality.
