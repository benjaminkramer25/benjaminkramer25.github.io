Hello! My name is Benjamin Kramer, and I am an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University studying mathematics. I'm from the Bay Area, however have resided in Cleveland the past few years. My non-academic interests include playing golf, tennis, or Go, as well as appreciating different architectural styles (in specific Art Deco, Baroque Revival, + Neoclassical) and reading philosophy. 

My research and academic interests lie in the computational biological, medical, and health sciences. I wish to apply mathematical methods and advanced algorithms to better solve issues in these fields, and I enjoy programming and computational problems immensely. My current subfields of interest are the dynamical systems modeling, genomic analysis through machine learning, as well as statistical regression from large health datasets to examine mechanisms of disease.

Previously, I have
- Worked for the <a class="about-link" href="https://www.oaklandca.gov/" target="_blank">City of Oakland's</a> District 4 encompassing Downtown and West Oakland on creating district databases for locations, requests, and solicitations, as well as policy analysis on Measure HH's Sugar Sweetened Beverage Distribution Tax.
- Worked at <a class="about-link" href="https://newsunroad.com/" target="_blank">New Sun Road</a> for two summers, an startup out of <a class="about-link" href="https://erg.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley ERG</a> performing hardware and software QC on the StellarEdge Internet of Things (IoT) controller for remote data acquistion and power systems, StarLink modems. Light improvements and development to the UI/UX and firmware of the StellarEdge's display board.
- Performed air quality and health research on countries in West Africa, in particular Benin, with <a class="about-link" href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/misbath-daouda" target="_blank">Professor Misbath Daouda</a> at <a class="about-link" href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley's Department of Public Health</a>, creating original visualizations and statistical significant analysis. My final presentation with graphs solely created throughout summer 2024 is here.
