Hello! My name is Benjamin Kramer, and I am an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University studying mathematics. I'm from and have lived throughout the Bay Area. I enjoy reading, playing golf, as well as the board games Go and chess.  

My research interest lie in computational biological, medical, and health sciences, specifically through advanced algorithms. Despite majoring in mathematics, I enjoy programming and computational problems immensely, and am currently interested in the modeling of dynamic systems, analysis of differentially expressed genes, as well as statistical regression to determine causality. 

Previously, I have
- Worked for the <a class="about-link" href="https://www.oaklandca.gov/" target="_blank">City of Oakland's</a> District 4 encompassing Downtown and West Oakland on creating district databases for locations, requests, and solicitations, as well as policy analysis on Measure HH's Sugar Sweetened Beverage Distribution Tax.
- Worked at <a class="about-link" href="https://newsunroad.com/" target="_blank">New Sun Road</a> for two summers, an startup out of <a class="about-link" href="https://erg.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley ERG</a>.
- Performed air quality and health research on countries in West Africa, in particular Benin, with <a class="about-link" href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/misbath-daouda" target="_blank">Professor Misbath Daouda</a> at <a class="about-link" href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley's Department of Public Health</a>, creating original visualizations and statistical significant analysis. My final presentation with graphs solely created throughout summer 2024 is here.
