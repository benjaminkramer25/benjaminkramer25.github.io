Hello! My name is Benjamin Kramer, and I am an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) studying mathematics. I'm from the Bay Area, however have resided in Cleveland the past few years. My non-academic interests include playing golf, tennis, or Go, as well as appreciating different architectural styles (in specific Art Deco, Baroque Revival, + Neoclassical) and reading philosophy. 

My research and academic interests lie in the computational biological, medical, and health sciences. I wish to apply mathematical methods and advanced algorithms to better solve issues in these fields, and I enjoy programming and computational problems immensely. My current subfields of interest are the dynamical systems modeling, genomic analysis through machine learning, as well as statistical regression from large health datasets to examine mechanisms of disease. 

**Previous research includes working at...**
- The joint CWRU Garvin and Gonzalez-Vicente Lab studying renal physiology. In particular, I worked on rodent kidney surgeries, and the microdissection of glomeruli, as well as using bioinformatics tools including R and Seurat for genomics analysis. My first [publication](publications) and abstract are related to this work.
- The <a class="about-link" href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley Department of Public Health</a> during an REU with <a class="about-link" href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/misbath-daouda" target="_blank">Professor Misbath Daouda</a>. I analyzed air pollution through satellite data in West Africa, using statistical modelling through Python. My final presentation with graphs created throughout June-August 2024 is [here](assets/items/BenjaminKramerBerkeleyPresentation2024.pptx). 

**Non-academic job experiences include working at...**
- <a class="about-link" href="https://newsunroad.com/" target="_blank">New Sun Road</a> for two summers, a startup out of <a class="about-link" href="https://erg.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley's ERG</a>. I performed hardware/software QC on the StellarEdge Internet of Things (IoT) controller. Also contributed to light improvements + development to the firmware of the StellarEdge's display board.
- <a class="about-link" href="https://www.oaklandca.gov/" target="_blank">The City of Oakland</a>, in particular District 4 (West + Downtown Oakland). Created district databases for locations, requests, and solicitations in Python. Performed policy analysis on revenue generated by Measure HH's Sugar Sweetened Beverage Distribution Tax.
